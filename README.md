# mid2beep

This small Python script allows you to play sounds through your PC speaker. It uses winsound and mido.

If you are running Windows 10 64 bit, you need to install BeepXP: https://www.waldbauer.com/tmp/dl.php?download=beepxp64

Two examples are currently included that do not use midi files. Fanfare.py utilizes note and duration conversions and MI.py directly provides note frequency and duration (in milliseconds).
