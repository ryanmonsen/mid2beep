# mid2beep

This small Python script allows you to play sounds through your PC speaker. It uses winsound and mido.

If you are running Windows 10 64 bit, you need to install BeepXP: https://www.waldbauer.com/tmp/dl.php?download=beepxp64

## Examples:

**Fanfare.py** utilizes note and duration conversions found in Beep.py for simple melodies.

**MI.py** directly provides note frequency and duration (in milliseconds).

**AlloRondo.py** uses mid2beep to convert allo_rondo.mid to note frequency and duration, and then plays it.
